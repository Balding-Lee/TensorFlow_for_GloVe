# TensorFlow_for_GloVe

The code for GloVe comes from book "`Natural Language Processing with TensorFlow`", written by `Thushan Ganegedare`. And the code at the top comes from `Stanford CS224n`, which is just a test for `SVD`.

The comments in the code are written by the author in English, and written by me in Chinese. As for the comments in markdown, most of them are translated from the author, and a small part are my feelings when writing code.
